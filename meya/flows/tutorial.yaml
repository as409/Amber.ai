                A Meya bot is made up of three things:
                `intents` are what triggers a bot response.
                `flows` are the steps that a bot runs through.
                `components` are code that the bot runs along the way.

    intent:
        component: meya.text_suggestions
        properties:
            text: >
                Each flow is triggered by an `intent`. An intent can be a keyword,
                regular expression, or a natural language model. You'll
                see the "intent" at the top of the flow editor. Click "Edit"
                to edit the intent.

        properties:
            text: >
                A `flow` is written in YAML code and defines the steps
                (called "states") a bot will take in response to an intent.
                At each state, a component (or another flow) can be invoked.

                A `component` is a unit of code written in Python or Node.js
                that does something useful. You can read data from the
                built-in database, make a call to a web API, perform a
                calculation, etc.

                As a bot designer you need to think about how these
                pieces should fit together to make a good user experience.
